The **Events** feature allows decoupled parts of the CMS to:

  1. Notify the rest of the system that something has happened, and
  2. React to things that happen elsewhere in the system.

## Interface

```ts
interface Events {
  dispatch(event: Event): void
  subscribe(eventType: string, listener: Listener): Unsubscribe
}

interface Event {
  type: string
  // Any other data may be added to the event.
  [key: string]: any
}

type Listener = (event: Event) => void

type Unsubscribe = () => void
```

## Usage

### Dispatching Events

```ts
cms.events.dispatch({
  type: 'something-happened',
})
```

### Subscribing to Events

The `cms.events.subscribe` function can be used to start listening for certain events.

```ts
cms.events.subscribe(EVENT_NAME, event => {
  // ...
})
```

The `EVENT_NAME` is a string that matches a pattern for the event name.

[Checkout the tests for specific examples of how the matching happens.](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/blob/master/packages/@tinacms/core/src/events.test.ts)

#### Log all Events

```ts
cms.events.subscribe('*', event => {
  console.log(event)
})
```

### Log when a Form Plugin is added

```ts
cms.events.subscribe("plugins:add:form", (event) => {
  console.log(`Added a Form called "${event.plugin.name}"`
})
```

#### Log all Form Events

```ts
cms.events.subscribe('plugins:*:form', event => {
  console.log(`Something happened to the form plugins`)
})
```

#### Log all Plugin Events

```ts
cms.events.subscribe('plugins', event => {
  console.log(`Something happened to the plugins`)
})
```

Note that the string `plugins`is equivalent to `plugins:*` or `plugins:*:*`.
